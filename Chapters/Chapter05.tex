	\ingredients
	{   
	    4 & Skinless chicken thighs\\
	    1 & Onion\\
		1 & Red bell pepper\\
		1-2 tsp & Salt \\
	}
	
	\preparation 
	{
	    \step Put the chicken in a pot and pour in water enough to just cover the chicken. Bring the chicken to boil and then lower the heat to low and let it simmer
	    \step Cut onion and red bell pepper into bite-size pieces and add them to the soup
	    \step Add more water to cover everything and a bit more
	    \step Bring the soup to boil again in medium-high heat then set the heat to low and let it simmer for about 1.5 hour or until the onion is clear and the red bell pepper is cooked thought. The soup should be clear and golden. While simmering, do not fully cover the lid on the pot. Tilt the lid a bit to let some steam evaporate but do not leave it open completely to prevent the soup reducing too much
	    \step Add salt at the end of the cooking to the level of your satisfactory
	}
	
	\hint
	{%
		Other vegetable like carrots and green leaves can be added for extra goodness. Also try adding 1 clove of garlic roughly chopped for extra flavouring :).
